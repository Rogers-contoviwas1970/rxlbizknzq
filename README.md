So I just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The King of Kings and dude, wow. It's like, one big epic train ride. I mean, Cecil B. DeMille really went all out with the whole Jesus thing, huh? I'm still processing. Honestly, it's like my brain's been hijacked by this  's visuals. The light and shadows alone, wow. But also, what a journey to get through it all. Kinda feels like running a marathon, honestly. A marathon with Roman soldiers and sandals, lol.

You know what I mean? It's one of those flicks where you're not even sure how you feel right after. One minute you're like, Okay, this is solid storytelling, and the next you're just guffawing at how extra it all gets. Super 1920s cinema drama, you know? Though, at some point, I was just shouting, Chill the hell out! at my screen. It’s exhausting but weirdly satisfying at the same time. Makes you wonder about how much work it took just to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   back in the day. 

>Yo, remember when we had to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on those clunky old PCs? Now it's like, bam, 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 it right to your phone or whatever. How did we survive before? Anyway, speaking of the old school, man, the music in this one. I'm like, floating in a sea of orchestral waves or something, and it's almost making the tiredness worth it. Almost.

There are these scenes where you wanna cry, but you're also kinda laughing at the same time 'cause it's just that over-the-top. It's like DeMille was both a director and his own hype-man, you know? And of course, he’s going all extra on the resurrection. No subtlety! Just spectacle!

print(Why did I add this line of code though?)

Anyway, what's even real now? That   was a trip. But hey, I feel like I need to go cleanse my brain with something less... biblical? Like a cat video or seven. Catch up later?
